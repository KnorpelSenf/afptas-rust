# afptas-rust

This is a pseudo version of the algorithm that reflects our current understanding of the problem.

```pseudo
fn afptas(I, epsilon):
  let (J,m,R) = I
  let n = length(J)
  let (j0,p0,r0), ..., (jn,pn,rn) = J
  
  let mapping = {
    j0: (0, 0.0),
    ...,
    jn: (0, 0.0),
  }
  
  # magic here

  return mapping 
```
